## Description

## Description:
Stay ahead of payment disputes with this automated n8n workflow that integrates Stripe, Slack, and ClickUp. Perfect for finance teams, payment ops specialists, and SaaS businesses, this template fetches disputes directly from Stripe, analyzes urgency, and instantly notifies your team with rich, formatted alerts.

High-priority disputes are flagged, pushed into Slack for immediate visibility, and tracked in ClickUp with due dates aligned to Stripe evidence deadlines—ensuring no dispute ever slips through the cracks.
