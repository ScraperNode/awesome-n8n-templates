## Description

#  AI-Powered LinkedIn Post Generator Workflow

##  Overview
This workflow is a **two-part intelligent content creation system** built in **n8n**, designed to generate professional and on-brand **LinkedIn posts**.

It combines a conversational **frontend agent** that interacts naturally with users and a **backend post generation engine** powered by structured templates and **Mistral Cloud AI models**.

---

##  Workflow Structure
- **Frontend:** Conversational “LinkedIn Agent” that guides the user.
- **Backend:** “Post Generator” engine that produces final, high-quality content using dynamic templates.

---

##  LinkedIn Agent (Frontend Flow)

- **Trigger:** `When chat message received`
  Starts the workflow whenever a user sends a message to the chatbot or embedded interface.

- **Agent:** `LinkedIn Agent`
  - Welcomes the user and lists **7 available post templates**:
    1. Educational  
    2. Promotional  
    3. Discussion  
    4. Case Study & Testimonial  
    5. News  
    6. Personal  
    7. General  
  - Prompts the user to select a **template number**.
  - Asks for a **topic** after the user’s choice.
  - Sends both `template number` and `topic` to the backend using a **Tool** call.

- **Memory:** `Simple Memory1`  
  Stores the last 10 messages to maintain conversational context.

- **LLM Model:** `Mistral Cloud Chat Model1`  
  Used for reasoning, conversational responses, and user guidance.

- **Tool Used:** `template`  
  Invokes another trigger in the same workflow: `When Executed by Another Workflow`.
  Passes the user’s chosen template and topic to the backend.

---

##  Post Generation Engine (Backend Flow)

- **Trigger:** `When Executed by Another Workflow`  
  Receives payload from the `template` tool (template ID + topic).

- **Router Node:** `Switch between templates`  
  - Directs flow to the correct post template logic based on user’s choice (1–7).  
  - Example:  
    - `1 → Knowledge & Educational`  
    - `2 → Promotion`  
    - `3 → Discussion`  
    - `4 → Case Study & Testimonial`  
    - etc.

- **Prompt Template Nodes:**  
  Each `Set` node defines a **large, structured prompt** containing:
  - Specific tone, audience, and purpose rules  
  - Example hooks and CTAs  
  - Layout and line formatting instructions  
  - “FORBIDDEN PHRASES” list (e.g., no “game-changer”, “revolutionary”)

- **Expert Writer Agent:** `post generator`  
  - A specialized agent node that receives the selected prompt template.  
  - Generates the final LinkedIn post text using strict formatting and tone rules.  
  - **Model:** `Mistral Cloud Chat Model`

- **Output:**  
  The generated post text is sent back to the `template` tool and displayed to the user in chat.
