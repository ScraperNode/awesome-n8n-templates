📝 **Overview**
This workflow transforms n8n into a smart real-estate concierge by combining an AI chat interface with [Bright Data](https://get.brightdata.com/ar8wlq0xkpv5)’s marketplace datasets. Users interact via chat to specify city, price, bedrooms, and bathrooms—and receive a curated list of three homes for sale, complete with images and briefings.

🔑 **Key Features**

* **AI-Powered Chat Trigger:** Instantly start conversations using LangChain’s Chat Trigger node.
* **Contextual Memory:** Retain up to 30 recent messages for coherent back-and-forth.
* **Bright Data Integration:** Dynamically filter “FOR\_SALE” properties by city, price, bedrooms, and bathrooms (limit = 3).
* **Automated Snapshot Retrieval:** Poll for dataset readiness and fetch full snapshot content.
* **HTML-Formatted Output:** Present results as a `<ul>` of `<li>` items, embedding property images.

🚀 **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Prerequisites:**

   * n8n ≥ v1.0
   * Community nodes: install `n8n-nodes-brightdata` (the unverified community node)
   * API credentials: OpenAI, Bright Data
   * Webhook endpoint to receive chat messages

2. **Node Configuration:**

   * **Chat Trigger:** Listens for incoming chat messages; shows a welcome screen.
   * **Memory Buffer:** Stores the last 30 messages for context.
   * **OpenAI Chat Model:** Uses GPT-4o-mini to interpret user intent.
   * **Real Estate AI Agent:** Orchestrates filtering logic, calls tools, and formats responses.
   * **Bright Data “Filter Dataset” Tool:** Applies user-defined filters plus `homeStatus = FOR_SALE`.
   * **Wait & Recover Snapshot:** Polls until snapshot is ready, then fetches content.
   * **Get Snapshot Content:** Converts raw JSON into a structured list.

3. **Workflow Logic:**

   * User sends search criteria → Agent validates inputs.
   * Agent invokes “Filter Dataset” once all filters are present.
   * Upon dataset readiness, the snapshot is retrieved and parsed.
   * Final output rendered as a bullet list with property images.

4. **Testing & Optimization:**

   * Use the built-in **Execute Workflow** trigger for rapid dry runs.
   * Inspect node outputs in n8n’s UI; adjust filter defaults or snapshot limits.
   * Tune OpenAI model parameters (e.g., `maxIterations`) for faster responses.

5. **Deployment & Monitoring:**

   * Activate the main workflow and expose its webhook URL.
   * Monitor executions in the “Executions” panel; set up alerts for errors.
   * Archive or duplicate workflows as needed; update credentials via credential manager.

✅ **Pre-requisites**

* **Bright Data Account:** API key for marketplaceDataset.
* **OpenAI Account:** Access to GPT-4o-mini model.
* **n8n Version:** v1.0 or later with community node support.
* **Permissions:** Webhook access, credential vault read/write.

👤 **Who Is This For?**

* Real-estate agencies and brokers seeking to automate client queries.
* PropTech startups building conversational search tools.
* Data analysts who want on-demand property snapshots without manual scraping.

📈 **Benefits & Use Cases**

* **Time Savings:** Replace manual MLS searches with an AI-driven chat.
* **Scalability:** Serve multiple clients simultaneously via webchat or embedded widget.
* **Consistency:** Always report exactly three properties, ensuring concise results.
* **Engagement:** Visual listings with images boost user satisfaction and conversion.
