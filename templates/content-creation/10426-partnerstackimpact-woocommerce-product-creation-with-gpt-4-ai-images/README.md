## 🎯 What This Automation Does

* ⏰ **Runs on a schedule** (e.g., daily at 10:00 or every 3 days)
* 📄 **Reads rows from Google Sheets** (your affiliate product registry)
* 🔗 **Inserts your affiliate link** (PartnerStack/Impact/CJ or manual)
* 🌐 **Fetches product/landing page** and parses key details
* 🤖 **Uses AI** to create product title, short & long HTML description
* 🖼️ **Creates a product image** from an AI image prompt
* 🗂️ **Uploads media to WordPress**, sets alt/title/caption
* 🛒 **Creates a WooCommerce External product** via REST API
* 🏷️ **Applies category by ID** and sets the featured image

## 🛠 Prerequisites

* ✅ n8n (self-hosted or Cloud)
* ✅ WordPress + WooCommerce with REST API enabled
* ✅ WordPress Application Password / API credential with media & products scope
* ✅ OpenAI (or your preferred AI) API key
* ✅ Google Sheet with minimum columns:

  * `AdvertiserIdandCompaignID` (unique key)
  * `AdvertiserUrl` (merchant/product URL)
  * `TrackingLink` (your affiliate URL)
  * `Brand`
  * `partner_status` (e.g., “Active”)
  * `product_published` (Yes/blank)
  * `error` (Yes/blank)

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1️⃣ Scheduling & Intake

* Add a **Schedule Trigger** (daily, every 3 days, or your cadence).
* **Google Sheets → Read**: pull rows from your “impact/partnerstack” tab.
* **Filter** rows: `partner_status = Active` AND `product_published != Yes` AND `error != Yes`.
* **Limit** to 1 per run (safe scaling). Increase later if needed.

### 2️⃣ Product Discovery & Parsing

* **HTTP Request** the `AdvertiserUrl` to fetch the landing/product page.
* Parse title/meta/summary; continue on error and flag failures (so runs don’t break).

### 3️⃣ AI Content Generation

* **Agent 1 – Basics:** Product Name, Short Description, Category ID mapping (match your Woo categories).
* **Agent 2 – Long Form:** SEO-ready **HTML** description (H2/H3, bullets, features, benefits, target users, technical highlights).
* **Agent 3 – Image Prompt:** Generate a clean product-hero prompt; then **AI Image** generation.

### 4️⃣ Media Handling

* **Upload media** to WordPress (`/wp/v2/media`) with title/alt/caption and proper content-type.
* Capture the **media ID** for the next step.

### 5️⃣ WooCommerce Product Creation

* **Create product** via `POST /wc/v3/products` with:

  * `type: "external"`
  * `name`, `short_description`, `description`
  * `external_url: TrackingLink`
  * `button_text: "Sign Up"` (or “Buy Now” / “Get It Now”)
  * `status: "publish"` (or “draft” if you want manual review)
* **Attach featured image** with the uploaded `media ID`.
* **Set categories** by **ID** (ensure your mapping is correct).

### 6️⃣ Post-Publish Updates

* **Update the Google Sheet row** using the unique key (`AdvertiserIdandCompaignID`):

  * `product_published = Yes`
  * Clear/reset any transient error flags.

### 7️⃣ Error Handling & Idempotency

* If fetch fails (e.g., Cloudflare/Turnstile), mark `error = Yes` and **skip** that row next run.
* Filter excludes `error = Yes` and already-published rows—no accidental duplicates.

---

## 💰 Optional Monetization & Distribution

* **Blog & Social:** Add branches to generate a blog article, LinkedIn/Twitter posts from the same product data.
* **Video:** Create a short promo video (Sora/Gen-AI) and auto-schedule to TikTok/YouTube/Instagram.
* **Email:** Trigger a campaign (e.g., Brevo/Mailchimp) for new products added this week.

---

## 💡 Advanced Customizations

* **Draft workflow:** publish products as `draft` for human QA.
* **Category Mapper:** expand the category ID table to fit your Woo taxonomy.
* **Image sizing:** add an optional resize/optimize node before upload.
* **Batching:** remove the Limit node to publish multiple products per run (respect rate limits).
* **Per-brand theming:** vary prompts (tone/structure) based on Brand column.

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

| Issue                         | Fix                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WordPress 401/403             | Re-create Application Password; ensure correct base URL & permalinks                     |
| Image upload fails            | Check content-type & binary upload settings; verify max upload size on server            |
| Product lacks image/category  | Confirm media ID capture & category ID mapping                                           |
| Duplicate items               | Ensure `product_published` is set to `Yes` after success; keep Limit node during testing |
| Fetch errors on merchant site | Keep “continue on error”; route to set `error = Yes`, then review manually               |

## 💡 Pro Tip

Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.
