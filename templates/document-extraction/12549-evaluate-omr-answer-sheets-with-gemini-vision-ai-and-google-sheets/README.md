## Description

## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?

Manual checking of OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) answer sheets is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale—especially for schools, coaching institutes, and exam centers.  
This workflow automates **OMR evaluation end-to-end** using AI, from reading a scanned answer sheet image to calculating scores and storing structured results in Google Sheets.

---

## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?

1. Accepts a **scanned OMR answer sheet image** via webhook.
2. Uses **AI vision** to extract only the marked answers from the sheet.
3. Extracts basic **student details** (Name, Roll Number, Class).
4. Compares extracted answers with a predefined **answer key**.
5. Calculates:
   - Total questions
   - Correct answers
   - Incorrect answers
   - Score percentage
6. Generates **question-wise binary results** (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect).
7. Stores the complete result in **Google Sheets**.
8. Returns a structured **JSON response** to the calling system.

## 🧠 How It Works – Step by Step

### 1. 📥 Webhook Trigger (Student OMR Upload)
- A client uploads the OMR image via a `POST` request.
- Image is received as `form-data` (`key: file`).

### 2. 👁️ AI-Based OMR Image Analysis
- An AI vision model analyzes the image.
- Strict rules ensure:
  - Only answer bubbles are considered
  - Multiple markings → darkest option is selected
  - Unmarked questions are skipped
  - No guessing or hallucination
- Output includes:
  - Student details
  - Question–answer pairs

### 3. 🔄 Answer Formatting
- Raw AI output is converted into a clean, structured format:
  - `1:A, 2:B, 3:C, ...`
- Student metadata is preserved separately.

### 4. 🧮 Answer Key Setup
- Correct answers are defined inside the workflow (editable anytime).
- Supports any number of questions.

### 5. 📊 Result Calculation
- User answers are compared with the answer key.
- Generates:
  - Correct / Incorrect counts
  - Percentage score
  - Detailed per-question result
  - Binary output (`Q.1 = 1 / 0`) for analytics

### 6. 📄 Google Sheets Logging
- Results are appended to a Google Sheet with columns such as:
  - Student Name
  - Roll No
  - Class
  - Correct
  - Incorrect
  - Score Percentage
  - Q.1 → Q.n (binary values)

### 7. 📤 API Response
- Workflow responds with a JSON payload containing:
  - Student details
  - Full evaluation summary
  - Per-question analysis
