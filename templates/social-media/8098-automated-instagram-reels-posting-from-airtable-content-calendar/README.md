## Description

*A guide to understand, operate, and extend the workflow.*

---

## 1) What this workflow does (and why it’s useful)

**Goal:** Turn a simple Airtable sheet into a **content calendar** that automatically publishes **Instagram Reels** via the **Instagram Graph API**, on a schedule you control in n8n.

**Why this matters:**
- Your team plans everything in **Airtable** (user-friendly, collaborative).
- **n8n** posts for you at the right time, every time.
- You keep full control (no third-party SaaS lock-in, no manual uploads).
- Later, you can reuse the same queue to post **YouTube Shorts** / **TikTok** (omnichannel).

**Core flow (one row = one post):**
1. **Cron** starts the workflow at a set time.
2. **Airtable – Search** grabs due rows: `status = "To Post" AND scheduled_at &lt;= NOW() AND platform = "IG"`.
3. **Split Out** processes each row individually.
4. **Set (Map fields)** normalizes Airtable fields → `video_url`, `caption`, `recordId`.
5. **IG: Create Media Container** registers your video as **REEL**.
6. **Wait 90s** lets IG process the video.
7. **IG: Publish Reel** publishes the container.
8. **Airtable – Update** marks the row as **Posted**, stores `ig_media_id`, and timestamp.

## 2) Architecture at a glance

```
[Cron] 
  → [Airtable: Search records]
    → [Split Out: records]
      → [Set: Map fields]
        → [IG: Create Media Container]
          → [Wait 90s]
            → [IG: Publish Reel]
              → [Airtable: Update record]
```

Sticky Notes inside the workflow explain each step (they’re rendered from `parameters.content` with Markdown).

## 3) Airtable schema (recommended)

Create a table (e.g., `Posts`) with these fields:

| Field         | Type            | Purpose                                               |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `video_url`   | URL or Text     | Directly accessible (public) URL to your MP4          |
| `caption`     | Long text       | Final caption (hashtags, line breaks, emojis)         |
| `platform`    | Single select   | Set `IG` for this workflow                            |
| `status`      | Single select   | `To Post` → will be picked up; `Posted` later         |
| `scheduled_at`| Date/Time (UTC) | When to post                                          |
| `ig_media_id` | Text (optional) | Filled by n8n after publishing                        |
| `posted_at`   | Date/Time       | Filled by n8n after publishing                        |

**Filter used in the Airtable “Search records” node:**
```
AND({status}='To Post', {scheduled_at}&lt;=NOW(), {platform}='IG')
```

&gt; Tip: If you localize/rename fields, update the filter accordingly.

## 4) Prerequisites & credentials

- **Instagram Business/Creator** account connected to a **Facebook Page**.
- **IG User ID** for the connected account.
- **Long-lived IG Access Token** with permissions to create and publish content.
- **n8n environment variables** (Settings → Environments):
  - `IG_API_VERSION` (e.g., `v21.0`)
  - `IG_USER_ID`
  - `IG_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- **Airtable credential** in n8n using a **Personal Access Token** (as in your example).
- A **publicly accessible** `video_url` (e.g., S3/GCS signed URL, public CDN, Drive/Dropbox direct link). The API pulls from your URL; it cannot fetch files behind logins.

## 5) Node-by-node deep dive (what each node expects/returns)

### A) Cron Trigger
- **What it does:** Starts the workflow on a schedule (daily at 09:00 in the template).
- **How to use:** Adjust hours/minutes to your cadence (hourly, twice a day, etc.).

### B) Airtable: Search records
- **Operation:** `search`
- **Base/Table:** Select from dropdowns (matches your account).
- **Options → filterByFormula:** `AND({status}='To Post', {scheduled_at}&lt;=NOW(), {platform}='IG')`
- **Return:** An array under `records[]`. Each `record` has `id` and `fields`.

### C) Split Out: records
- **What it does:** Turns the `records[]` array into individual items.
- **Why:** Downstream steps can then act on each post separately.

### D) Set: Map fields
- **What it does:** Normalizes data to predictable keys and keeps the `recordId`.
- **Outputs:**  
  - `recordId` = `{{$json.id}}`  
  - `video_url` = `{{$json.fields.video_url}}`  
  - `caption` = `{{$json.fields.caption}}`  
  - `scheduled_at` = `{{$json.fields.scheduled_at}}`

### E) IG: Create Media Container (REELS)
- **Endpoint:** `POST https://graph.facebook.com/{v}/{ig-user-id}/media`
- **Body params:**
  - `video_url` = `{{$json.video_url}}`
  - `caption` = `{{$json.caption}}`
  - `media_type=REELS`
  - `share_to_feed=true` (optional)
  - `access_token=${IG_ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- **Return:** JSON with **container id** under `id` (this is your `creation_id` for publishing).

### F) Wait 90s
- **Why:** IG needs time to process the video behind `video_url`.
- **Tip:** If your videos are large or high bitrate, you may increase to `120–180s`.

### G) IG: Publish Reel
- **Endpoint:** `POST https://graph.facebook.com/{v}/{ig-user-id}/media_publish`
- **Body params:**
  - `creation_id = {{$json.id}}` (the container id from step E)
  - `access_token = ${IG_ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- **Return:** JSON with **`id` = ig_media_id** (the published media).

### H) Airtable: Update record
- **What it does:** Writes results back to the same row.
- **Fields updated (example):**
  - `status = "Posted"`
  - `ig_media_id = {{$json.id}}`
  - `posted_at = {{$now}}`

## 6) First-run checklist (do this once)

1. In **both Airtable nodes**, pick your **Base** and **Table** (via dropdown).
2. Confirm **filterByFormula** matches your field names exactly.
3. Add **one test row** in Airtable:  
   - `video_url` = a public MP4 URL  
   - `caption` = a small caption  
   - `platform` = `IG`  
   - `status` = `To Post`  
   - `scheduled_at` = in the past (so it’s due now)
4. Set **Cron** to run in the next minute (or click *Execute Workflow* manually).
5. Confirm the flow:
   - Airtable search → returns 1 record  
   - Container created → you get an `id`  
   - After 90s → Publish returns a `media id`  
   - Airtable updated → row becomes `Posted` with `ig_media_id` and `posted_at`

---

## 7) Daily operations (how to use it day-to-day)

- Your team fills **Airtable** with upcoming posts.
- Keep `status = To Post`, set accurate `scheduled_at` in **UTC**.
- n8n’s **Cron** checks regularly and posts due items.
- After publishing, the row is marked **Posted** (so it won’t re-post).

**Backfilling:**  
If you need to post a bunch of older content, set `scheduled_at` in the past for those rows and let Cron pick them up. If needed, run the workflow manually.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.
