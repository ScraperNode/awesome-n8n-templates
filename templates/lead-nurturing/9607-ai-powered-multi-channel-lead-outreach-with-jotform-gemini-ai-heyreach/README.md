## Description

# 🧠 AI-Powered Outreach Engine (Jotform + Gemini AI + HeyReach + Data Tables)

## 🚀 Overview  
This workflow turns every **Jotform submission** — whether from your website or a live marketing campaign — into a **fully automated, AI-personalized outreach sequence**.  

Using **Google Gemini AI**, it instantly generates LinkedIn messages and email content tailored to each lead’s company and context.  
Depending on the data provided (like LinkedIn profile or email), it automatically routes the message to the right platform — **HeyReach for LinkedIn outreach** or **Gmail for email follow-up** — and logs all activity into **n8n Data Tables** for tracking and visibility.  

The result? Zero manual copywriting, zero campaign setup, and instant activation of every inbound lead through personalized, human-sounding communication.

## ⚙️ What It Does  
- **Trigger:** Starts when a new submission is received from a Jotform attached to your website or ongoing campaign.  
- **Lead Enrichment (Optional):** You can add an enrichment node (like Clearbit) to pull company, role, and domain details.  
- **AI Message Generation:**  
  - Uses **Google Gemini AI (LangChain)** to write both a **LinkedIn outreach message** and a **short, conversational email**.  
  - Each message is context-aware — referencing the company, role, or query captured from the Jotform submission.  
- **Conditional Routing Logic:**  
  - If the form includes a **LinkedIn URL**, the workflow sends the lead and message to **HeyReach**, adding them to the correct campaign automatically.  
  - If not, it sends the **email variant** via **Gmail**, ensuring no lead is missed.  
- **Data Tracking:**  
  - All lead details, messages, and campaign statuses are automatically saved into **n8n Data Tables**, creating a single source of truth for your outreach history.  
- **Result:** Personalized, multi-channel follow-up happens in seconds — turning inbound form leads into active, engaged prospects instantly.

## 🧠 Example Use Case  
Imagine a SaaS or marketing agency running a “Request a Demo” or “Get Pricing” campaign via a Jotform on their website.  
With this workflow, every time someone fills the form:  
1. Their details are captured and stored in **n8n Data Tables**.  
2. **Gemini AI** instantly writes a relevant, human-sounding LinkedIn and email message.  
3. The lead is automatically added to a **HeyReach campaign** or receives a **Gmail follow-up** if LinkedIn isn’t available.  
4. All statuses (message type, delivery, and timing) are tracked in real time.  

This workflow replaces hours of manual effort with automated, AI-personalized communication that feels natural — not robotic.

## 💡 Pro Tip

If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.
