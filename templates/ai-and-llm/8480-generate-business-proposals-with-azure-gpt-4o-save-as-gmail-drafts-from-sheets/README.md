**Description:**

Accelerate your sales cycle with this n8n workflow template that automatically generates professional business proposals and saves them as Gmail drafts—ready to send. No more manual writing or formatting—let AI create polished proposals tailored to each client.

This automation pulls client and deal data from Google Sheets, checks if the lead has reached the Proposal stage, and uses AI to draft structured proposals with clear sections like scope, deliverables, pricing, and timelines.
