## 🏡 AI-Powered Real Estate Lead Qualifier (n8n Workflow)

## Description
This n8n workflow automates lead engagement and qualification for real estate buyers. When someone submits a form on your real estate website, the system instantly responds via SMS, starting a conversation powered by an AI Agent. The AI asks pre-qualifying questions (like budget, location, and timeline), logs the entire conversation, and then summarizes and sends the lead info to a real estate agent. Chat history is stored in a PostgreSQL database (via Supabase) and tied to each buyer's phone number.

## Key Features
📩 Instant SMS Response: Follows up immediately after form submission.

🤖 AI Chat-Based Qualification: Conversational agent gathers buyer needs and preferences.

🗂 Supabase Chat Memory: Stores chat history tied to the buyer’s phone number to maintain context.

📊 Lead Summary & Agent Handoff: Summarizes conversation and logs it to Google Sheets for the agent.

🔁 Customizable AI Questions: Easily edit the questions asked by the AI to suit your process.
