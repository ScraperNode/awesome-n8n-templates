## Generate 7-Day Event Plans with Google Calendar, GPT-3.5 and Notion 🎉  
### *Automate Your Event Planning: From Calendar Entry to Done-For-You Checklist*

Stop scrambling before birthdays, anniversaries, or family gatherings. This workflow turns a simple **Google Calendar event** into a **7-day prep plan** — complete with shopping lists, tasks, and reminders — all auto-sent to **Notion** and your inbox.

Perfect for:
- 👩‍👧 Homemakers hosting family events
- 💼 Solopreneurs planning launches or webinars
- 🎉 Anyone who wants to celebrate without the stress

The workflow:
1. 📅 Detects a new event in Google Calendar (e.g., “Emma’s Birthday”)
2. 🤖 Uses **GPT-3.5** to generate a 7-day prep plan (buy cake, send invites, decorate)
3. 📝 Creates a **Notion page** for the event, then **loops through each AI-generated task** to add them as individual rows/items with due dates
4. 📨 Emails you a summary + link to the Notion page

No spreadsheets. No mental load. Just **set the date — and let AI handle the rest**.

&gt; 🔁 **Key Detail**: After the Notion page is created, the workflow uses an **Item Lists node** to split the AI-generated task array into individual items. Each task is then processed in a loop and appended to the Notion database as a separate row — ensuring clean, actionable checklists.
