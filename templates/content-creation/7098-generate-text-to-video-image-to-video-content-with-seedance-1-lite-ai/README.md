# Generate Text-to-Video & Image-to-Video Content with Seedance 1 Lite AI

Built with **n8n + Replicate**

This workflow takes a **prompt** (and optional seed), sends it to Bytedance’s **seedance-1-lite model**, waits for processing, and returns a generated video.

---

## ⚡ Section 1: Start & Authenticate

* **▶️ On clicking ‘execute’** → Manual trigger to start the workflow.
* **🔑 Set API Key** → Stores your Replicate API key so all requests are authorized.

**Benefit:** Keeps your API credentials secure and reusable.

---

## 🛠️ Section 2: Send Video Generation Request

* **📡 Create Prediction** → Makes a POST request to Replicate with:

  * `prompt`: your text description of the video
  * `seed`: (optional) controls randomness for reproducibility
  * Model version: `b6519549e375404f45af5ef2e4b01f651d4014f3b57d3270b430e0523bad9835`

**Benefit:** Kickstarts AI video generation from just a simple text prompt.

---

## 🔍 Section 3: Track the Prediction

* **📦 Extract Prediction ID** → Stores `predictionId`, `status`, and `predictionUrl` for polling.
* **⏳ Wait** → Pauses 2 seconds between checks.
* **🔁 Check Prediction Status** → Calls Replicate to see if the video is ready.
* **✅ Check If Complete** → Branches:

  * If status = `succeeded` → continue.
  * Else → loop back to **Wait** until it’s finished.

**Benefit:** Ensures the workflow patiently monitors progress without timing out.

---

## 📽️ Section 4: Process & Return Results

* **📦 Process Result** → Outputs a clean response containing:

  * `status`
  * `video_url` (generated video)
  * `metrics`
  * `created_at` & `completed_at`
  * `model: bytedance/seedance-1-lite`

**Benefit:** Gives you structured data and the direct video link, ready to share or store.
