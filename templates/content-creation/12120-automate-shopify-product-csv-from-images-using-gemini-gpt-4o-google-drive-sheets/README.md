# Shopify AI Automation
# Image-to-Product CSV Bulk Upload Automation

This **Shopify AI automation** is an advanced n8n-powered workflow that converts raw product images into a **Shopify-ready product CSV**.  
It uses AI image analysis, Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Shopify APIs to fully automate product onboarding — from images to structured ecommerce data.

Built for scalable **ecommerce automation**, this workflow is especially effective for image-first catalogs such as jewelry, fashion, and accessories.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ **AI Image Analysis** — Analyzes product images one by one for higher accuracy and lower risk

- ✍️ **AI Product Content Generation** — Creates product names, descriptions (HTML), tags, and attributes  
- 📄 **Google Sheets Orchestration** — Structures data and outputs a clean Shopify-compatible CSV

## 🧩 Workflow Preparation

Before running the workflow:

1. Upload all product images to **Google Drive**
2. Name images using the format:
&lt;SKU&gt;&lt;ColorCode&gt;
Example: 12345GR

3. Place all images inside a folder named:&lt;Brand Name&gt;
4. Root folder name : pending

Example :
- 
Google_Drive/pending/Manish Collection/All Images


Each image represents one product variant.

## ⚙️ How It Works

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Fetch Images from Google Drive

---

### Step 2: AI Image Analysis (One-by-One)

---

### Step 4: Conditional Product Content Generation
Based on category:
- Product titles are generated
- Descriptions are written in Shopify-ready HTML
- Tags and attributes are created

This replaces repetitive work typically handled via **Shopify Flow** or manual data entry.

---

### Step 5: Shopify Image Upload
- Images are uploaded to Shopify assets
- Shopify returns CDN URLs
- URLs are mapped back to product data

---

### Step 6: Shopify CSV Generation
- All enriched data is compiled into a new Google Sheet
- Output matches Shopify’s product import CSV format
- File is ready for bulk upload
