## Description

The  AI Support Agent combines Gmail, Slack, and Google Drive into a seamless support workflow powered by GPT-4o and Pinecone.

🧠 Email Monitoring – New support emails are pulled from Gmail every minute.
📤 Classification – AI categorizes emails (e.g., billing, support, spam, urgent).
📚 Knowledge-Based Replies – GPT-4o drafts personalized replies using your support documents synced from Google Drive and stored in Pinecone.


📩 Automatic Response – The agent replies to the customer in the same Gmail thread.
🚨 Escalation Detection – If human support is needed, Slack is notified instantly.
📊 Logging – Each interaction is logged in Google Sheets for tracking and analysis.
🔁 Live Sync – Any document added to your Google Drive folder is auto-loaded into the knowledge base for future AI responses.
