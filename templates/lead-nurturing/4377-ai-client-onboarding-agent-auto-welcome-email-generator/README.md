# AI Client Onboarding Agent: Auto Welcome Email Generator

This workflow automates **welcoming new clients**. When someone submits a form, their details are pulled from Google Sheets, a personalized onboarding checklist is generated using **Google Gemini**, and an email is sent directly to the client. It also includes error handling to ensure nothing is missed.

## 🟢 Section 1 – Trigger & Client Data Capture

**Nodes:**

* ⏰ **Trigger on New Client Form Submission** → Fires when a new row is added in Google Sheets (from the client’s form).
* 🧍 **Extract and Structure Client Data** → Collects and formats client details: name, email, company, services, extra info.

✅ **Beginner view:** This is the **doorway**. When a client fills the form, their info is automatically pulled into the workflow.

---

## 📑 Section 2 – Checklist & Personalization

**Nodes:**

* 📋 **Client Checklist** → Creates a default onboarding checklist (account setup, welcome call, docs, etc.).
* 🧠 **Personalize Using Gemini** → Sends client details + checklist to Google Gemini AI → generates a tailored onboarding email body.

✅ **Beginner view:** This is where the **magic happens**. Instead of a boring generic email, each client gets a **customized message** that feels personal.

---

## 📤 Section 3 – Delivery & Completion

**Nodes:**

* 📧 **Send Email to Client** → Sends the personalized onboarding email directly to the client’s inbox.
* ✅ **Execution Completed** → Marks the workflow as successfully finished.

✅ **Beginner view:** Think of this as the **final handshake** with the client — they get a warm, professional onboarding email without you lifting a finger.

---

## 🚨 Section 4 – Error Handling

**Nodes:**

* ⚠️ **Error Handler** → Captures any failure in the workflow.
* ❌ **Execution Failure** → Defines fallback/alert action if something breaks.

✅ **Beginner view:** This is your **safety net**. If an email fails or Gemini is unavailable, the workflow won’t just stop — you can set it up to alert you.
