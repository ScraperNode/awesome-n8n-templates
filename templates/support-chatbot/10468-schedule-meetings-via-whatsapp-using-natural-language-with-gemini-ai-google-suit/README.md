## Description

### 🚀 How It Works  
Turn your WhatsApp chats into an **AI-powered meeting scheduler** with **Google Gemini**, **Google Calendar**, and **Google Sheets**.  
This workflow understands natural language like _“Book a meeting with Ali at 3 PM tomorrow”_, checks your contacts, avoids overlaps, and updates your calendar automatically all from WhatsApp.  

It’s a complete AI scheduling system built for founders, teams, and service providers who manage clients over chat.

- **Google Sheets** → Finds contact names, emails, and tags  
- **Get Events** → Checks existing meetings to prevent conflicts  
- **Correction Agent + Intent Check** → Confirms details with AI  
- **Calendar Agent (Gemini)** → Executes the calendar action intelligently  
- **Create / Update / Delete Event** → Syncs instantly to Google Calendar  
- **Response Node** → Sends WhatsApp and email confirmations

4. **Customize Prompts** – adjust tone and language in the Gemini nodes  
5. **Test Your Flow** – e.g., message “Schedule meeting with Ali at 10 AM Friday” to verify calendar and confirmation replies
