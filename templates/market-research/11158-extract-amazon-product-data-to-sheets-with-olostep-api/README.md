> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

# Olostep Amazon Products Scraper  

This n8n template automates Amazon product scraping using the Olostep API.  
Simply enter a **search query**, and the workflow scrapes multiple Amazon search pages to extract product titles and URLs.  
Results are cleaned, normalized, and saved into a Google Sheet or Data Table.

## Who’s it for  
- E-commerce analysts researching competitors and pricing  
- Product sourcing teams  
- Dropshippers and Amazon sellers  
- Automation builders who want quick product lists without manual scraping  
- Growth hackers collecting product data at scale  

## How it works / What it does  
1. **Form Trigger**  
   - User enters a search query (e.g., “wireless bluetooth headphones”).  
   - The query is used to build the Amazon search URL.

2. **Pagination Setup**  
   - A list of page numbers (1–10) is generated automatically.  
   - Each number loads the corresponding Amazon search results page.

3. **Scrape Amazon with Olostep**  
   - For each page, Olostep scrapes Amazon search results.  
   - Olostep’s LLM extraction returns:  
     - **title** — product title  
     - **url** — product link  

4. **Parse & Split Results**  
   - The JSON output is decoded and turned into individual product items.

5. **URL Normalization**  
   - If the product URL is relative, it is automatically converted into a full Amazon URL.

6. **Conditional Check (IF node)**  
   - Ensures only valid product URLs are stored.  
   - Helps avoid scraping Amazon navigation links or invalid items.

7. **Insert into Sheet / Data Table**  
   - Each valid product is saved in:  
     - title  
     - url  

8. **Automatic Looping & Rate Management**  
   - A wait step ensures API rate limits are respected while scraping multiple pages.

This workflow gives you a complete, reliable Amazon scraper with no browser automation and no manual copy/paste — everything runs through the Olostep API and n8n.

## How to set up  
1. Import this template into your n8n account.  
2. Add your **Olostep API key**.  
3. Connect your **Google Sheets** or **Data Table**.  
4. Deploy the form and start scraping with any Amazon search phrase.

## Requirements  
- Olostep API key  
- Google Sheets or Data Table  
- n8n cloud or self-hosted instance  

## How to customize the workflow  
- Add more product fields (price, rating, number of reviews, seller name, etc.).  
- Extend pagination range (1–20 or more pages).  
- Add filtering logic (e.g., ignore sponsored results).  
- Send scraped results to Notion, Airtable, or a CRM.  
- Trigger via Telegram bot instead of a form.
