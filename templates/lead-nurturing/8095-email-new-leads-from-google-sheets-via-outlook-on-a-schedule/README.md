> ⚡ **3,769 views** · 💬 [Lead Nurturing & AI Sales Agents](../)

## Description

Send a templated outreach email to **new leads** in a Google Sheet on a **daily schedule**, then **mark each lead as contacted** so they won’t be emailed twice. Built with: **Schedule Trigger → Google Sheets → Filter → Outlook Send Email → Google Sheets (append/update)**.

---

## Who’s it for
- Teams that collect leads in Sheets and want automatic, once-per-lead outreach  
- Solo founders/consultants running simple top-of-funnel follow-ups  
- Anyone prototyping CRM-lite flows in n8n

---

## How it works / What it does
1. **Schedule Trigger** runs daily (e.g., 09:00).
2. **Get rows (Google Sheets)** pulls leads from your sheet.
3. **Filter** keeps only rows where `Contacted` is **empty**.
4. **Outlook – Send a message** emails each remaining lead (`to = {{$json.Email}}`).
5. **Google Sheets (appendOrUpdate)** writes back `Contacted = Yes` (match on `Email`) to prevent re-sending.


---

## How to set up
### 1) Google Sheets (OAuth2)
- In **n8n → Credentials → New → Google Sheets (OAuth2)**, sign in and grant access.  
- In **Get rows**: select your **Lead Source** sheet (e.g., “New Leads”).  
- In **Append/Update**: select the sheet you want to mark as contacted (can be the same sheet or a CRM sheet).  
- Make sure your sheet has at least: `Email`, `Contacted` (blank for new).

### 2) Outlook (Microsoft Graph) OAuth2
- **n8n Cloud (quick connect):**  
  - In **Credentials → New → Microsoft Outlook OAuth2**, choose **Connect**, sign in with your Microsoft account, and accept permissions.
- **Self-hosted (Azure App Registration):**  
  1) Azure Portal → **App registrations** → **New registration**.  
  2) Add redirect URL: `https://YOUR_N8N_URL/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`.  
  3) **API permissions (Delegated):** `offline_access`, `Mail.Send`, `User.Read`. Grant admin consent if required.  
  4) Create a **Client secret**; copy **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.  
  5) In n8n, create **Microsoft Outlook OAuth2** credential with those values and scopes: `offline_access Mail.Send openid email profile`.  
- In the **Send a message** node, select that credential and keep `To` mapped to `{{$json.Email}}`.  
- Customize **Subject** and **Body** to your brand (default provided).

## Requirements
- A Google Sheet of leads with an **Email** column (and an optional **Contacted** column).  
- A Microsoft account with permission to send mail via **Microsoft Graph** (Outlook).

---

## How to customize the workflow
- **Email content:** Edit subject/body (add variables like `{{$json.FirstName}}`).  
- **Send window:** Change Schedule Trigger time/interval.  
- **Idempotency:** Use the same sheet for read+write (match on `Email`) or separate source/CRM sheets.  
- **Logging:** Add a Sheet or Notion append step after send for an audit trail.

---

## Security & best practices
- **No hardcoded secrets:** Always use **OAuth2 credentials** (Sheets & Outlook).  
- **Sanitize PII:** If publishing, **remove real spreadsheet IDs/URLs** and personal emails/phone numbers.  
- **Sticky notes are mandatory:** Add a **yellow sticky note** in the workflow with this description and a short setup checklist. Use neutral sticky notes for per-node tips.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **No emails sent:** Ensure `Contacted` is blank for new rows and the Filter checks “is empty.”  
- **Auth errors (Outlook):** Reconnect credential; confirm Graph scopes and tenant consent.  
- **Sheets errors:** Re-select spreadsheet/tab; verify headers (`Email`, `Contacted`).  
- **Duplicates:** Confirm **Append/Update** uses **matching column = Email**.
