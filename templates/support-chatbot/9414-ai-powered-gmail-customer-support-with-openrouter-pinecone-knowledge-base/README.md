> ⚡ **236 views** · 💬 [Support Chatbots](../)

## Description

This workflow automates **customer email support** by combining Gmail, AI classification, and a knowledge base to provide instant, accurate, and friendly responses. It’s designed for businesses that want to improve customer satisfaction while reducing manual workload.

## 🚀 How it Works

1. **Gmail Trigger**  
   The workflow listens for new incoming Gmail messages.

2. **Text Classification**  
   Each email is classified using AI as either *Customer Support* or *Other*.  
   - If it’s *Other*, the workflow stops.  
   - If it’s *Customer Support*, the email continues to the AI agent.

3. **AI Agent with Knowledge Base**  
   The AI agent:  
   - Reads the customer’s message.  
   - Searches the **Pinecone Knowledge Base** for FAQs and policies.  
   - Generates a helpful, polite, and detailed reply using an **OpenRouter model**.  
   - Signs off as *Mrs. Helpful from Tech Haven Solutions*.

4. **Reply to Gmail**  
   The drafted email is automatically sent back to the customer.

## 💡 Value

- ✅ **Save Time** – No more manual triaging and drafting of replies.  
- ✅ **Consistency** – Every answer is based on your own FAQ/policies.  
- ✅ **Customer Satisfaction** – Fast, friendly, and accurate responses 24/7.  
- ✅ **Scalable** – Handle higher email volume without scaling headcount.
