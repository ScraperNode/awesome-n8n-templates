## Description

How it works
This workflow lets users generate AI images directly from Telegram messages using:

Google Gemini API – to convert text to detailed, high-quality image prompts.

Pollinations API – to generate free AI images from the prompts.

Telegram Bot – to interact with users and return generated images instantly.

It’s fully automated using n8n — from text message to stunning image, all in one flow.
Perfect for creators, content marketers, or anyone wanting quick visuals on the go.

🧩 Estimated setup time: ~10–15 minutes
