# 📖 Smarter RAG agents with enriched retrieval and modular workflows

> ⚡ **2,436 views** · 📖 [Internal Wiki & Knowledge Base](../)

## Description

An extendable RAG template to build powerful, explainable AI assistants — with query understanding, semantic metadata, and support for free-tier tools like Gemini, Gemma and Supabase.

## Description
This workflow helps you build smart, production-ready RAG agents that go far beyond basic document Q&A.

It includes:

✅ File ingestion and chunking

✅ Asynchronous LLM-powered enrichment

✅ Filterable metadata-based search

✅ Gemma-based query understanding and generation

✅ Cohere re-ranking

✅ Memory persistence via Postgres



Everything is modular, low-cost, and designed to run even with **free-tier LLMs and vector databases**.

Whether you want to build a chatbot, internal knowledge assistant, documentation search engine, or a filtered content explorer — this is your foundation.


## ⚙️ How It Works
This workflow is divided into 3 pipelines:

### 📥 Ingestion
- Upload a PDF via form
- Extract text and chunk it for embedding
- Store in Supabase vector store using Google Gemini embeddings


### 🧠 Enrichment (Async)
- Scheduled task fetches new chunks
- Each chunk is enriched with LLM metadata (topics, use_case, risks, audience level, summary, etc.)
- Metadata is added to the vector DB for improved retrieval and filtering


### 🤖 Agent Chat
- A user question triggers the RAG agent
- Query Builder transforms it into keywords and filters
- Vector DB is queried and reranked
- The final answer is generated using only retrieved evidence, with references
- Chat memory is managed via Postgres

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Asynchronous enrichment** → Save tokens, batch process with free-tier LLMs like Gemma
- **Metadata-aware** → Improved filtering and reranking
- **Explainable answers** → Agent cites sources and sections
- **Chat memory** → Persistent context with Postgres
- **Modular design** → Swap LLMs, rerankers, vector DBs, and even enrichment schema
- **Free to run** → Built with Gemini, Gemma, Cohere, Supabase (free tier-compatible)



## 🔐 Required Credentials

|Tool|Use|
|-|-|-|
|Supabase w/ PostreSQL|Vector DB + storage|
|Google Gemini/Gemma|Embeddings & LLM|
|Cohere API|Re-ranking|
|PostgreSQL|Chat memory|



## 🧰 Customization Tips
- Swap extractFromFile with Notion/Google Drive integrations

- Extend Metadata Obtention prompt to fit your domain (e.g., financial, legal)

- Replace LLMs with OpenAI, Mistral, or Ollama 

- Replace Postgre Chat Memory with Simple Memory or any other

- Use a webhook instead of a form to automate ingestion

- Connect to Telegram/Slack UI with a few extra nodes


## 💡 Use Cases
- Company knowledge base bot (internal docs, SOPs)

- Educational assistant with smart filtering (by topic or level)
- Legal or policy assistant that cites source sections
- Product documentation Q&A with multi-language support
- Training material assistant that highlights risks/examples
- Content Generation


## 🧠 Who It’s For
- Indie developers building smart chatbots
- AI consultants prototyping Q&A assistants
- Teams looking for an internal knowledge agent
- Anyone building affordable, explainable AI tools

## 🚀 Try It Out!

Deploy a modular RAG assistant using n8n, Supabase, and Gemini — fully customizable and almost free to run.

#### 1. 📁 Prepare Your PDFs

- Use any internal documents, manuals, or reports in **PDF **format.

- Optional: Add Google Drive integration to automate ingestion.

#### 2. 🧩 Set Up Supabase

- Create a free Supabase project

- Use the table creation queries included in the workflow to set up your schema.

- Add your *supabaseUrl *and *supabaseKey *in your n8n credentials.

&gt; 💡 Pro Tip:
Make sure you match the embedding dimensions to your model.
This workflow uses *Gemini text-embedding-04* (768-dim) — if switching to OpenAI, change your table vector size to 1536.

#### 3. 🧠 Connect Gemini & Gemma

- Use Gemini/Gemma for embeddings and optional metadata enrichment.

- Or deploy locally for lightweight async LLM processing (via Ollama/HuggingFace).

#### 4. ⚙️ Import the Workflow in n8n

- Open n8n (self-hosted or cloud).

- Import the workflow file and paste your credentials.


You’re ready to ingest, enrich, and query your document base.


## 💬 Have Feedback or Ideas? I’d Love to Hear

This project is open, modular, and evolving — just like great workflows should be :).
