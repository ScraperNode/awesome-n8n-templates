### Workflow

1. The Webhook node will receive image data from a macOS shortcut in Base64 format.  
2. The Convert to File node will convert the Base64 image into a binary file.  
3. The AI Agent node will process the binary image. It utilizes OpenRouter, Windows buffer memory, MarketStack, and the SerpAPI tool.  
4. Remember to use a model capable of processing images; otherwise, the workflow will throw an error.  
5. We use the MarketStack tool to fetch the latest stock data; however, it is rarely used.  
6. SerpAPI is used for market research, such as news and insights about stocks.  
7. Finally, the Markdown node converts Markdown to HTML.  
8. The response is then sent to the Webhook.
