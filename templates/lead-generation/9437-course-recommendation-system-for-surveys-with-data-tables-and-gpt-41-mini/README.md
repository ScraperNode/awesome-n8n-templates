> ⚡ **3,862 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

## Description

Use the **n8n Data Tables** feature to store, retrieve, and analyze survey results — then let OpenAI automatically recommend the most relevant course for each respondent.

---

## 🧠 What this workflow does
This workflow demonstrates how to use **n8n’s built-in Data Tables** to create an internal recommendation system powered by AI.

It:
- Collects **survey responses** through a Form Trigger  
- Saves responses to a **Data Table** called `Survey Responses`  
- Fetches a list of available courses from another **Data Table** called `Courses`  
- Passes both Data Tables into an **OpenAI Chat Agent**, which selects the most relevant course  
- Returns a structured recommendation with:
  - `course`: the course title  
  - `reasoning`: why it was selected  

&gt; **Trigger:** Form submission (manual or public link)

## 👥 Who it’s for
Perfect for educators, training managers, or anyone wanting to use **n8n Data Tables** as a lightweight internal database — ideal for AI-driven recommendations, onboarding workflows, or content personalization.

## ⚙️ How to set it up
### 1️⃣ Create your **n8n Data Tables**
This workflow uses **two Data Tables** — both created directly inside n8n.

#### 🧾 Table 1: `Survey Responses`
Columns:
- `Name`
- `Q1` — Where did you learn about n8n?
- `Q2` — What is your experience with n8n?
- `Q3` — What kind of automations do you need help with?

To create:
1. Add a **Data Table node** to your workflow.  
2. From the list, click **“Create New Data Table.”**  
3. Name it **Survey Responses** and add the columns above.

---

#### 📚 Table 2: `Courses`
Columns:
- `Course`
- `Description`

To create:
1. Add another **Data Table node**.  
2. Click **“Create New Data Table.”**  
3. Name it **Courses** and create the columns above.  
4. Copy course data from this Google Sheet:  
   👉 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0Q0CnqN0w47c5nCpbA1O3sn0mQaKXPhql2Bc1UeiFY/edit?usp=sharing

This **Courses Data Table** is where you’ll store all available learning paths or programs for the AI to compare against survey inputs.

---

### 2️⃣ Connect OpenAI
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)  
2. Create an API key  
3. In n8n, open **Credentials → OpenAI API** and paste your key  
4. The workflow uses the **gpt-4.1-mini** model via the LangChain integration

## 🧩 Key Nodes Used
| Node | Purpose | n8n Feature |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Form Trigger** | Collect survey responses | Forms |
| **Data Table (Upsert)** | Stores results in `Survey Responses` | **Data Tables** |
| **Data Table (Get)** | Retrieves `Courses` | **Data Tables** |
| **Aggregate + Set** | Combines and formats table data | Core nodes |
| **OpenAI Chat Model (LangChain Agent)** | Analyzes responses and courses | AI |
| **Structured Output Parser** | Returns structured JSON output | LangChain |

---

## 💡 Tips for customization
- Add more **Data Table columns** (e.g., email, department, experience years)  
- Use another **Data Table** to store AI recommendations or performance results  
- Modify the **Agent system message** to customize how AI chooses courses  
- Send recommendations via **Email**, **Slack**, or **Google Sheets**

---

## 🧾 Why Data Tables?
This workflow shows how **n8n’s Data Tables** can act as your internal database:
- Create and manage tables directly inside n8n  
- No external integrations needed  
- Store structured data for AI prompts  
- Share tables across multiple workflows  

All user data and course content are stored securely and natively in **n8n Cloud or Self-Hosted** environments.
