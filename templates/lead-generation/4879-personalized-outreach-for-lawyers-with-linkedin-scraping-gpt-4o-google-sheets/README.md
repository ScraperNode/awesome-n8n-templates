> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

![Screenshot 20250612 120714.png](fileId:1513)
 ⚠️ This template uses only official n8n nodes. No community nodes required.

## 🧑‍💼 Who is this for?

This workflow is designed for:
- Legal tech founders
- Marketing freelancers or consultants
- Agencies supporting lawyers and small law firms
- Anyone doing outbound outreach in the legal niche

## ❓ What problem is this solving?

LinkedIn is a goldmine for targeting legal professionals — but scraping and personalizing outreach is tedious and expensive. Most tools either:
- Require paid LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Can’t personalize at scale
- Violate LinkedIn’s TOS

This workflow solves that by using **free Google Search**, **OpenRouter AI**, and **GPT-4o** to find, enrich, and message up to **1,000 solo lawyers per day** — without using browser automation or scrapers.

## ⚙️ What this workflow does

1. Uses **Google Programmable Search** to find solo lawyers and small firm founders on LinkedIn
2. Parses each profile’s name, title, profile URL, and snippet
3. Saves raw lead data to Google Sheets
4. Uses **OpenRouter Sonar Pro** to enrich each profile with external content
5. Generates a personalized, 1-line message using **GPT-4o**
6. Appends the final message into Google Sheets for outreach

## 🛠️ Setup

Estimated time: **15–20 minutes**
