## Extract and Organize Receipt Data with WhatsApp, GPT-4V and Google Sheets 📸  
### *Turn Photos of Receipts into a Smart, Automatic Expense Log — No Typing, No Stress*

You’re not bad at budgeting.  
You’re not disorganized.  
You’re just **drowning in paper**.

A receipt from the school fundraiser.  
The oil change you forgot to log.  
That grocery run after soccer practice.  
The birthday gift you bought last-minute online.

They start in your wallet.  
Then your purse.  
Then the car seat.  
Then… gone.

And when tax time comes?  
You’re left guessing.  
Stress rises.  
Confidence drops.

What if you could just… **snap, send, and forget**?

Introducing **Snap & Save** — a gentle, powerful automation that turns your **phone’s camera** into a **smart expense tracker**, using AI to read receipts, categorize spending, and build a clean, living log — all in the background.

No spreadsheets.  
No data entry.  
No more “I *know* I had that receipt!”

Just peace of mind.

### 💡 How It Works: Effortless, Step by Step

This workflow runs quietly in the background — like a personal assistant who *actually* listens.

#### 1. 📸 **Snap a Photo of Your Receipt**
At the store, in the car, at the kitchen table — just take a clear photo of any receipt.  
It doesn’t matter if it’s crumpled, handwritten, or half-torn. As long as the total is visible, AI can read it.

#### 2. 📲 **Send It to WhatsApp**
Forward the photo to your **private WhatsApp number or group** (e.g., “My Receipts”).  
No new apps. No extra steps. Just the tool you already use every day.

#### 3. 🤖 **AI “Sees” the Receipt (Using `vlmRun`)**
This is the magic moment.

The **Vision Language Model (VLM)** — the same AI tech behind GPT-4V — *looks at the image* and understands it like a human would.

It extracts:
- 🏪 **Vendor** (e.g., Walmart, Shell, Etsy)
- 📅 **Date** (even if handwritten!)
- 💵 **Total Amount** and currency
- 🧾 **Item type** (if visible)

No OCR errors. No manual typing. Just smart, accurate reading.

#### 4. 🧹 **Auto-Categorize with Simple Logic**
The workflow uses a **Function node** to sort your spending:
- “Walmart” → **Groceries**
- “Shell” → **Fuel**
- “Amazon” → **Online**
- “Art Supply Co” → **Kids**
- “Therapy” → **Self-Care**

You can customize these rules in plain English — no coding needed.  
Want to track “Date Nights” or “Gifts”? Just add it.

#### 5. 📊 **Save to Google Sheets — Your Living Expense Log**
Every receipt becomes a row in a clean, organized spreadsheet:
| Date | Vendor | Amount | Category | Image Link |
|------|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| 2025-04-05 | Walmart | $87.42 | Groceries | [View] |

You can:
- Add monthly totals
- Create charts
- Share with your partner or accountant
- Export for taxes

And because it’s in **Google Sheets**, it works on any device — no new software to learn.
