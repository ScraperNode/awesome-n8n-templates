## Description

## Amazon Luna Prime Games Catalog Tracker (Auto-Sync to Google Sheets)**

Automatically fetch, organize, and maintain an updated catalog of **Amazon Luna – Included with Prime** games.This workflow regularly queries Amazon’s official Luna endpoint, extracts complete metadata, and syncs everything into Google Sheets without duplicates.

Ideal for:

* tracking monthly **Prime Luna rotations**
  
* keeping a personal archive of games
  
* monitoring **new games appearing on Amazon Games / Prime Gaming**, so you can instantly play titles you’re interested in
  
* building dashboards or gaming databases
  
* powering notification systems (Discord, Telegram, email, etc.)
  

* * *

### **Overview**

Amazon Luna’s “Included with Prime” lineup changes frequently, with new games added and old ones removed.Instead of checking manually, this n8n template fully automates the process:

* Fetches the latest list from Amazon’s backend
  
* Extracts detailed metadata from the response
  
* Syncs the data into Google Sheets
  
* Avoids duplicates by updating existing rows
  
* Supports all major Amazon regions
  

Once configured, it runs automatically—keeping your game catalog correct, clean, and always up to date.

#### 🛠️ **How the workflow works**

**1. Scheduled Trigger**

Starts the workflow on a set schedule (default: every 5 days at 3:00 PM).You can change both frequency and time freely.

**2. HTTP Request to Amazon Luna**

Calls Amazon Luna’s regional endpoint and retrieves the full **“Included with Prime”** catalog.

**3. JavaScript Code Node – Data Extraction**

Parses the JSON response and extracts structured fields:

* Title
  
* Genres
  
* Release Year
  
* ASIN
  
* Image URLs
  
* Additional metadata
  

The result is a clean, ready-to-use dataset.

**4. Google Sheets – Insert or Update Rows**

Each game is written into the selected Google Sheet:

* Existing games get updated
  
* New games are appended
  

The **Title** acts as the unique identifier to prevent duplicates.

💡 **Tips & Customization**

#### 🌍 Regional catalogs

Duplicate the HTTP Request + Code + Sheet block to track multiple countries (US, DE, JP, UK…).

#### 🧹 No duplicates

The workflow updates rows intelligently, ensuring a clean catalog even after many runs.

#### 🗂️ Move data anywhere

Send the output to:

* Airtable
  
* Databases (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB…)
  
* Notion
  
* CSV
  
* REST APIs
  
* BI dashboards
  

#### 🔔 Add notifications (Discord, Telegram, Email, etc.)

* game title
  
* description or metadata
  
* **the game’s image**, automatically downloaded and attached
  

This makes notifications visually informative and perfect for tracking new Prime titles.
