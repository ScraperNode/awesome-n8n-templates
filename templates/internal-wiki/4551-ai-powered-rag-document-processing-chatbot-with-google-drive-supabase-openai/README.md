## Description

## **Who is this for?**

This workflow is perfect for:

* Businesses and teams who need an automated solution to organize, analyze, and retrieve insights from their internal documents.
* Researchers who want to quickly analyze and query large collections of research papers, reports, or datasets.
* Customer support teams looking to streamline access to product documentation and support resources.
* Legal and compliance professionals needing to reference and query legal documents with confidence.
* AI enthusiasts and developers wanting to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems without starting from scratch.

## **What problem is this workflow solving?**

Manually organizing, processing, and searching through documents can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This workflow solves that by:

* **Automating document processing** from Google Drive, supporting multiple formats like PDFs, CSVs, and Google Docs.
* **Extracting, chunking, and enhancing document text**, preserving context and improving AI comprehension.
* **Storing vector embeddings** in a secure, scalable Supabase vector database, enabling semantic search and retrieval.
* **Providing an interactive AI chat interface** that allows users to ask natural language questions and get precise, document-based answers.

This means teams can quickly access relevant insights from their document repositories—boosting productivity and ensuring accurate information retrieval.

## **Key Features**

* 🚀 **End-to-End Document Processing**: From Google Drive upload detection to vector embedding and storage.
* 🔍 **Semantic Search & Retrieval**: Users can ask complex, natural-language questions and receive contextually relevant answers.
* 🤖 **AI-Powered Summaries & Metadata**: Automatically generates document titles and summaries using Google Gemini AI.
* 📝 **Smart Chunking & Contextual Enhancement**: Breaks documents into smart chunks with overlap, preserving context and table integrity.
* 🔐 **Secure & Scalable Vector Database**: Stores and retrieves embeddings in a Supabase vector store for fast, reliable searches.
* 💬 **Conversational AI Interface**: Uses OpenAI to power natural, accurate, and cost-effective AI chat interactions.

## **How does this workflow work?**

* Monitors Google Drive for new files
* Extracts text from PDFs and CSVs (or Google Docs auto-converted)
* Splits text into context-preserving chunks
* Enhances chunk quality and stores embeddings in Supabase
* Enables natural language search and AI-powered chat interactions with the stored documents

## **Typical Use Cases**

* 📚 Corporate Knowledge Base
* 🔬 Research Paper Analysis
* 📞 Customer Support Document Query
* ⚖️ Legal Document Review and Analysis
* 🔍 Internal Team Documentation Search

## **Why You’ll Love It**

This workflow lets you build a scalable, searchable, and AI-powered document system—without needing to write complex code or manage multiple systems. With this, you can:

* Stay organized with automated document processing.
* Deliver faster, more accurate answers to user queries.
* Reduce manual work and improve productivity.
* Gain a competitive edge with cutting-edge AI search capabilities.

## **Setup Requirements**

* An n8n instance with Google Drive, Supabase, OpenAI, and Gemini credentials configured.
* Access to a Supabase vector store for storing document embeddings.
* Configurable chunk size, overlap, and processing limits (default: 1000 characters per chunk, 20 chunks max).
