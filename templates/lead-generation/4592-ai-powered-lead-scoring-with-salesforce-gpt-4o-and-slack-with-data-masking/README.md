## Description

Boost your sales team’s efficiency with an end-to-end, privacy-first lead-scoring engine—ready to drop straight into your n8n instance.

🔹 What it does

Salesforce Trigger watches for new or updated Leads every hour.

HTTP Request fetches the full record so you never miss a field.

Mask Data (JS Code) automatically tokenises PII (name, email, address, etc.) before any external call—ideal for GDPR/SOC 2 compliance.

OpenAI (GPT-4o) scores each lead 0-100, assigns a grade A-F, lists key reasons, recommends one next action, and even drafts a personalised email template.

Unmask Data (JS Code) swaps the tokens back in only when you explicitly need them—so sensitive data never leaks to logs or AI prompts.

Slack Node delivers a concise, team-friendly summary (score, grade, reasons, next step, and draft email) right to the rep who needs it.

🔹 Why you’ll love it

Security by design – field-level masking with reversible tokens.

No-code friendly – clear sticky notes explain every step; swap Salesforce for any CRM in minutes.

AI you can trust – scoring rubric baked into the system prompt for consistent results.

Instant hand-off – reps get an actionable Slack message instead of another spreadsheet.

Perfect for rev-ops teams that want smarter prioritisation without rebuilding their stack—or exposing customer data. Plug it in, set your own masking list, and start converting the leads that matter most.
