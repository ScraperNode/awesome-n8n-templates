## Description

**Description:**

Automatically detect and flag high-value sales orders as VIP in Zoho CRM using this intelligent n8n workflow. Ideal for eCommerce platforms, sales automation tools, or ERP systems, this automation template listens to incoming order data via webhook, checks if the sales order amount exceeds a set threshold (₹10,000 or $10,000), and updates the CRM with a VIP tag in real time.

Whether you're scaling your operations or building a smart sales pipeline, this template ensures no important order goes unnoticed—real-time tagging of premium clients made easy.

**What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)**

🔔 Webhook Trigger (Sales Order Intake)
- Receives real-time POST requests from your e-commerce, POS, or order management system
- Captures order details, including total value ($json.body.salesorder.total)

⚖️ High-Value Condition Check
- Evaluates whether the sales order value exceeds a custom threshold (default: 10,000)
- If order total &gt; 10,000, continues the workflow
- Otherwise, halts execution (no CRM action)

🏷️ Zoho CRM VIP Tagging
