## Description

##  **Auto-Edit Google Drive Images with Nano Banana + Social Auto-Post**

Drop an image into Google Drive and let this workflow handle the rest: it auto-cleans and enhances the image with Google’s Nano Banana (via Wavespeed API), generates a catchy caption with GPT-5, and publishes directly to your connected social accounts using Postiz.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Heads up — if this workflow's Instagram scraping breaks (it happens whenever Meta updates their frontend), [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/instagram) is a community node that handles [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/profiles), [posts](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/posts), [reels](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/reels), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/comments) without any HTML parsing.
