## Description

## Description
 Automate your AI-powered outreach and follow-up pipeline end-to-end with GPT-4o, Gmail, and Google Sheets. 🤖📬
 This workflow personalizes emails for each lead, manages follow-ups automatically, tracks client replies, and updates CRM records in real time — all from a single Google Sheet. Ideal for sales and growth teams looking to convert leads faster without manual effort. ⚙️🚀

## What This Template Does
 1️⃣ Starts manually when you click “Execute workflow.” 🕹️
 2️⃣ Fetches all leads from the Google Sheet (sample_leads_50). 📊
 3️⃣ Validates email format and filters only active (unbooked) leads. 🔍
 4️⃣ Uses Azure OpenAI GPT-4o to generate short, personalized outreach emails in HTML. ✉️
 5️⃣ Cleans and parses the AI output (subject + HTML body). 🧠
 6️⃣ Sends the first outreach email via Gmail and stores its thread ID. 📤
 7️⃣ Waits 24 hours, then checks for a client reply in the Gmail thread. ⏱️
 8️⃣ If a positive reply is found → marks lead as BOOKED and updates in Sheets. ✅
 9️⃣ If no reply → triggers a polite follow-up email, waits again 24 hours, and checks the thread a second time. 🔁
 🔟 If a second reply is found → marks BOOKED and logs the client message.
 
1️⃣1️⃣ If still no response → updates status to Declined in Google Sheets. ❌
 
1️⃣2️⃣ Logs invalid or incomplete leads to a separate sheet for data cleanup. 🧾
