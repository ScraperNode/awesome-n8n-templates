## Description

This n8n workflow acts as an AI-powered Inbox Assistant that automatically summarizes and classifies Gmail emails, prioritizes important messages, and sends a daily digest to Slack. It’s ideal for startup founders and small teams juggling investor intros, customer leads, and support queries — all from a busy Gmail inbox.

Each email is processed using ChatGPT to generate a concise summary, classify the message (e.g., Support, Investor, Spam), and determine its urgency. High and medium priority messages are forwarded to Slack instantly. Lower priority emails are logged to Google Sheets for review. A daily 7 PM digest summarizes the day’s most important messages.
