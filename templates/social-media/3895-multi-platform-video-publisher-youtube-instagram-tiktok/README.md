### Hi! I'm Amanda ❤️
I build intelligent automation flows with n8n and Make. This one is for all content creators, marketing teams, and agencies who want to **publish once and post everywhere**.

With this workflow, you can upload a single video to **YouTube**, **Instagram Reels**, and **TikTok** — simultaneously and automatically.

---

### ✅ What the workflow does

- Downloads a video from a provided URL  
- Uploads the video to your **YouTube** channel with title and description  
- Publishes it as a **Reel on Instagram** via the Meta Graph API  
- Sends the same video to **TikTok** using their official API  
- Supports credential input via `Set` node (tokens, titles, descriptions)

---

### ⚙️ Nodes & Tech Used

- `HTTP Request` – Download video and handle uploads to Instagram & TikTok  
- `YouTube` node – Official n8n integration for video upload  
- `Set` node – For handling user inputs (tokens, titles, video URLs)  
- `Switch`, `Wait`, `Merge` – Logic to control publishing status  
- Manual or webhook start available

---

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Open the workflow in your **n8n (Cloud or self-hosted)** instance  
2. Edit the `Set` node called `Credentials` and fill in:
   - `Token Instagram`  
   - `Token Tiktok`  
   - `YouTube title`, `description`, and `video URL`  
   - Instagram account ID  
3. Connect your YouTube OAuth credentials in the **YouTube** node  
4. Optionally, trigger via webhook to automate from other apps (Typebot, CRM, Drive)  
5. Hit "Execute Workflow" or schedule via cron

## 💡 Pro Tip

Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.
