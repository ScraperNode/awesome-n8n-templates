## Description

# Facebook Page Comment Moderation Scoreboard → Team Report


This workflow automatically monitors Facebook Page comments, analyzes them using AI for intent, toxicity & spam, stores moderation results in a database and sends a clear summary report to Slack and Telegram.

This workflow runs every few hours to fetch Facebook Page comments and analyze them using OpenAI. Each comment is classified as positive, neutral or negative, checked for toxicity, spam & abusive language and then stored in Supabase. A simple moderation summary is sent to Slack and Telegram.

You receive:

* Automated Facebook comment moderation
* AI-based intent, toxicity, and spam detection
* Database logging of all moderated comments
* Clean Slack & Telegram summary reports

Ideal for teams that want visibility into comment quality without manually reviewing every message.


### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
2. Add your **Facebook Page access token** to the HTTP Request node.
3. Connect your **OpenAI API key** for comment analysis.
4. Configure your **Supabase** table for storing moderation data.
5. Connect **Slack and Telegram** credentials and choose target channels.
6. Activate the workflow — moderation runs automatically.


## What It Does

This workflow automates Facebook comment moderation by:

1. Running on a scheduled interval (every 6 hours).
2. Fetching recent comments from a Facebook Page.
3. Preparing each comment for AI processing.
4. Sending comments to OpenAI for moderation analysis.
5. Extracting structured moderation data:
	* Comment intent
	* Toxicity score
	* Spam detection
	* Abusive language detection
6. Flagging risky comments based on defined rules.
7. Storing moderation results in Supabase.
8. Generating a summary report.
9. Sending the report to Slack and Telegram.

This ensures consistent, repeatable moderation with no manual effort.
