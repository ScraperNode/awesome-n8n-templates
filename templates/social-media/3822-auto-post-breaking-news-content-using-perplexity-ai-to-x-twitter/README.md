> ⚡ **4,709 views** · 📱 [Social Media & Email Marketing](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Twitter's API is paid now, which makes simple data pulls expensive. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/twitter) is a community node that scrapes [Twitter profiles](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/profiles) and [posts](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/posts) without needing API access.

## Description

Stay ahead of the curve and keep your followers informed—automatically.  
This n8n workflow uses Perplexity AI to generate insightful answers to scheduled queries, then auto-posts the responses directly to X (Twitter).

### ⚙️ What this workflow does

1. **Scheduled Trigger** – Runs at set times (daily, hourly, etc.).
2. **searchQuery** – Define what kind of trending or relevant insight you want (e.g. “latest AI trends”).
3. **set API Key** – Securely insert your Perplexity API key.
4. **Perplexity API Call** – Fetches a short, insightful response to your query.
5. **Post to X** – Automatically publishes the result as a tweet.
