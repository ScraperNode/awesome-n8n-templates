> ⚡ **915 views** · 🎬 [Content Creation & Video](../)

## Description

## 📄 What this workflow does
 Every 3 hours, the workflow fetches 3 random English words, asks Gemini to generate a short Vietnamese vocabulary digest (word, Vietnamese meaning, and an example sentence), and sends it to a Telegram chat. Perfect for steady, low-effort vocab exposure in groups.

## 👤 Who is this for
- English learners who want a gentle, automated learning cadence.
- Teachers/tutors who share daily vocab in Telegram groups.
- Community admins who want lightweight, useful content for members.
- Anyone who prefers bite-sized language learning on autopilot.


## ✅ Requirements
- Gemini API access (configured in n8n).
- Telegram Bot token + chat ID (the chat you want to receive messages).
- Internet access to Random Word API (no API key required).
- n8n instance with outbound HTTPS access.


## ⚙️ How to set up
1. Add your Gemini credentials in n8n (the Google Gemini/PaLM node).
2. Add your Telegram credentials and set the chatId in the “Send a text message” node.
3. (Optional) Adjust the schedule interval (default: every 3 hours).
4. (Optional) Change the number of words by updating the HTTP Request URL param words=3.
5. (Optional) Edit the Gemini prompt language/content to fit your style (currently Vietnamese output).
6. Run once to test; confirm the message arrives in Telegram.

## 🔁 How it works
1. Schedule Trigger → runs every 3 hours.
2. HTTP Request → calls random-word-api to get 3 words.
3. Edit Fields (Set) → wraps the API response under word.
4. Aggregate → prepares the word field for the LLM.
5. Message a model (Gemini) → creates a Vietnamese digest: English word, Vietnamese meaning, and example sentence for each word.
6. Send a text message (Telegram) → posts the digest to your specified chat.
