## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

# 🤖 AI-Powered Document QA System using Webhook, Pinecone + OpenAI + n8n

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using n8n, and create a simple Question Answer system using Webhook to connect with User Interface (created using Lovable):

🧾 Downloads the pdf file format documents from Google Drive (contract document, user manual, HR policy document etc...) 

📚 Converts them into vector embeddings using OpenAI

🔍 Stores and searches them in Pinecone Vector DB

💬 Allows natural language querying of contracts using AI Agents

## 📂 Flow 1: Document Loading & RAG Setup
This flow automates:

Reading documents from a Google Drive folder

Vectorizing using text-embedding-3-small

Uploading vectors into Pinecone for later semantic search

### 🧱 Workflow Structure
  A [Manual Trigger] --&gt; B[Google Drive Search]
  B --&gt; C[Google Drive Download]
  C --&gt; D[Pinecone Vector Store]
  D --&gt; E[Default Data Loader]
  E --&gt; F[Recursive Character Text Splitter]
  E --&gt; G[OpenAI Embedding]

#### 🪜 Steps
Manual Trigger: Kickstarts the workflow on demand for loading new documents.

Google Drive Search & Download

Node: Google Drive (Search: file/folder)

Downloads PDF documents

#### Apply Recursive Text Splitter: Breaks long documents into overlapping chunks
Settings:
Chunk Size: 1000
Chunk Overlap: 100

#### OpenAI Embedding
Model: text-embedding-3-small
Used for creating document vectors

#### Pinecone Vector Store
Host: url
Index: index
Batch Size: 200

#### Pinecone Settings:
Type: Dense
Region: us-east-1
Mode: Insert Documents

## 💬 Flow 2: Chat-Based Q&A Agent
This flow enables chat-style querying of stored documents using OpenAI-powered agents with vector memory.

### 🧱 Workflow Diagram

  B --&gt; C[OpenAI Chat Model]
  B --&gt; D[Simple Memory]
  B --&gt; E[Answer with Vector Store]
  E --&gt; F[Pinecone Vector Store]
  F --&gt; G[Embeddings OpenAI]

### 🪜 Components
Chat (Trigger): Receives incoming chat queries

AI Agent Node

#### Handles query flow using:

Chat Model: OpenAI GPT

Memory: Simple Memory

Tool: Question Answer with Vector Store

Pinecone Vector Store: Connected via same embedding index as Flow 1

Embeddings: Ensures document chunks are retrievable using vector similarity

Response Node: Returns final AI response to user via webhook

## 🌐 Flow 3: UI-Based Query with Lovable
This flow uses a web UI built using Lovable to query contracts directly from a form interface.

### 📥 Webhook Setup for Lovable
Webhook Node

Method: POST
URL:url
Response: Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node

### 🧱 Workflow Logic

  F --&gt; G[Embeddings OpenAI]
  B --&gt; H[Respond to Webhook]

### 💡 Lovable UI
Users can submit:

Full Name
Email
Department
Freeform Query: User can enter any freeform query.

Data is sent via webhook to n8n and responded with the answer from contract content.

### 🔍 Use Cases
Contract Querying for Legal/HR teams

Procurement & Vendor Agreement QA

Customer Support Automation (based on terms)

RAG Systems for private document knowledge

### ⚙️ Tools & Tech Stack

📌 Final Notes
Pinecone Index: package1536

Dimension: 1536

Chunk Size: 1000, Overlap: 100

Embedding Model: text-embedding-3-small
