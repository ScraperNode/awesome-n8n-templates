### 🎯 Who is this for?
This workflow is for **content creators, marketers, and agencies** who want to use **Veed.io’s AI avatar technology** to produce short, engaging TikTok videos automatically.  
It’s ideal for creators who want to appear on camera without recording themselves, and for teams managing multiple brands who need to generate videos at scale.

### ⚙️ What problem this workflow solves
Manually creating videos for TikTok can take hours — finding trends, writing scripts, recording, and editing.  
By combining **Veed.io**, **ElevenLabs**, and **GPT-4**, this workflow transforms a simple Telegram input into a **ready-to-post TikTok video** featuring your **AI avatar powered by Veed.io** — speaking naturally with your cloned voice.

This automation links Veed.io’s video-generation API with multiple AI tools:
- Analyzes TikTok trends via **Perplexity AI**  
- Writes a 10-second **viral script** using **GPT-4**  
- Generates your **voiceover** via **ElevenLabs**  
- Uses **Veed.io (Fabric 1.0 via FAL.ai)** to animate your avatar and sync the lips to the voice  
- Creates an engaging **caption + hashtags** for TikTok virality  
- Publishes the video automatically via **Blotato TikTok API**  
- Logs all results to **Google Sheets** for tracking

## 💡 Pro Tip

Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.
