* `NOTION_CLIENTS_DB_ID` → Notion **Clients** DB
* `NOTION_TESTIMONIALS_DB_ID` → Notion **Testimonials** DB

**Testimonials** → `Email`, `Rating (number)`, `Quote (text)`, `Permission (checkbox)`, `Published (checkbox)`

## Setup (5 Steps)

1. **Import** the JSON into n8n.
2. **Connect credentials**: Notion + Email (no keys in nodes).

## How It Flows (node map)

Gumroad Webhook → Function (map payload) → Notion (create client) → Email (Delivery) → Wait 3d → Email (Tips) → Wait 7d → Function (build testimonial link) → Email (Ask)
Testimonial Webhook → Function (map rating) → Notion (create testimonial) → Email (owner notify) → Respond (thank-you)

---

## Testing & Troubleshooting

* Emails not sending? Attach Email credentials + set **From**.
* Testimonial not saving? Check `PUBLIC_N8N_URL` + Notion DB IDs.
* Long delays use **Wait** nodes; keep **Save Execution Progress** ✅.
