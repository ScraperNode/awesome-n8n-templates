## Description

**Description**
This workflow automatically classifies user queries and retrieves the most relevant information based on the query type. 🌟 It uses adaptive strategies like;
   Factual, Analytical, Opinion, and Contextual to deliver more precise and meaningful responses by leveraging n8n's flexibility. Integrated with Qdrant vector store and Google Gemini, it processes each query faster and more effectively. 🚀

**How It Works?**
Query Reception: A user query is triggered (e.g., through a chatbot interface). 💬

*Classification*: The query is classified into one of four categories:

*Factual*: Queries seeking verifiable information.

*Analytical*: Queries that require in-depth analysis or explanation.

*Opinion*: Queries looking for different perspectives or subjective viewpoints.

*Contextual*: Queries specific to the user or certain contextual conditions.

*Adaptive Strategy Application*: Based on classification, the query is restructured using the relevant strategy for better results.

Response Generation**: The most relevant documents and context are used to generate a tailored response. 🎯
