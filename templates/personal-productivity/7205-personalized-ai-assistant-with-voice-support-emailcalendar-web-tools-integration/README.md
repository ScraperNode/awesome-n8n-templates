## Description

✨ Intro
This workflow shows how to go beyond a “plain” AI chatbot by:

🧠 Adding a Personality Layer — Link an extra LLM to inject a custom tone and style. Here, it’s Nova, a sassy, high-fashion assistant. You can swap in any personality without changing the main logic.

🎨 Custom Styling with CSS — Easily restyle the chatbot to match your brand or project theme.

Together, these make your bot smart, stylish, and uniquely yours.

⚙️ How it Works
