## Description

## 📊 Description
Streamline management decision-making by automatically evaluating high-priority tenders, generating AI-powered executive summaries, and routing them for approval inside Slack. 🤖📩 This workflow pulls pending tenders from Airtable, uses GPT-4o-mini to evaluate urgency, business opportunity, and risk, and generates a structured summary with a Go/No-Go recommendation. Tenders that qualify are pushed to Slack with interactive approval buttons, and the final decision instantly updates Airtable and triggers a confirmation email to your bid team. Perfect for fast-moving procurement, bidding, and sales teams that require structured, high-quality tender assessments. 📊⚡

 3️⃣ Generates structured JSON output:

 4️⃣ Formats AI output for Slack review and Airtable updates. 📝
 5️⃣ Checks if tender qualifies as “High urgency + High score + Go.” 🚦
 6️⃣ Sends interactive Slack message with Approve/Reject buttons. 💬
 7️⃣ If approved → updates Airtable status to Approved and sends Gmail confirmation. 📧
 8️⃣ If rejected or low-score → updates Airtable status accordingly. ✏️
