### 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1️⃣ Schedule or Manual Trigger
- **Node**: `Schedule Workflow` or `Test Workflow`
- **Purpose**: Either run daily via a cron-like rule or manually trigger the flow.

#### 2️⃣ Get Google Sheet Data
- **Node**: `Get Data`
- **What it does**: Fetches all rows from your connected sheet.
- **Setup**:
  - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
  - Create a new project
  - Enable **Google Sheets API**
  - Create OAuth2 credentials for a desktop or web application
  - Connect your Google account in n8n via OAuth2
  - Grant access to the sheet you want to read (ensure it's shared with your OAuth email)
  - Use the copied sheet's link when connecting in n8n

#### 3️⃣ Summarize Spend by Day
- **Node**: `Sum spend by Day`
- **What it does**: Groups the dataset by `Date` and sums the `Spend ($)` column
- **Requirements**:
  - Your sheet must have a header row with `Date` and `Spend ($)` as columns

#### 4️⃣ Sort by Most Recent Date
- **Node**: `Sort Dates Descending`
- **What it does**: Sorts all entries by the `Date` field so that the most recent day is first
- **Custom JavaScript**:
```js
const items = $input.all();
items.sort((a, b) =&gt; new Date(b.json.Date) - new Date(a.json.Date));
return items;
```

#### 5️⃣ Select Top Result
- **Node**: `Keep only Last Day`
- **What it does**: Captures the top row (most recent day) for evaluation
- **Fields**: Sets only `Date` and `sum_Spend_($)` to keep things clean

#### 6️⃣ Check Spend Threshold
- **Node**: `Check if Spend over $100`
- **What it does**: Uses an IF node to compare `sum_Spend_($)` against a 100 threshold
- **Logic**:
```json
sum_Spend_($) &gt; 100
```

#### 7️⃣ Send Slack Notification
- **Node**: `Send Slack Message`
- **What it does**: Sends a message to a Slack channel if the threshold is exceeded
- **Setup**:
  - Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
  - Create a new app
  - Enable **chat:write** and **channels:read** scopes under OAuth & Permissions
  - Install the app to your workspace
  - Copy the OAuth Token into your Slack credentials in n8n
  - Select your target channel from the dropdown (must be public or the bot must be invited)
- **Message**:
  ```
  The spend for the most recent day is over $100
  ```

#### 8️⃣ No Action if Under Budget
- **Node**: `Do Nothing. Under 100`
- **Purpose**: This path simply ends the flow with no action if spend is below the threshold
