## Description

🚀 What this template does


Automatically finds and enriches key contacts in a deal’s buying group by combining the company domain from the HubSpot deal with the buying group criteria you define (departments, seniorities, countries, job titles). It then pushes these contacts into HubSpot and emails your team a clean summary with direct HubSpot links—so no decision-maker falls through the cracks.

Before starting, make sure you have:
Buying Group Criteria Excel – Contains two sheets:
Buying group reference values (reference list)
Your Buying Group Criterias (where you define your filters)
You’ll import the Excel file into Google Sheets during setup.
1. ❓ What Problem Does This Solve?
When a new opportunity/deal is created, sales teams often miss adjacent decision-makers (e.g., VP Sales, Head of Marketing). This template searches for those people, enriches their contact data, adds/updates them in HubSpot, and notifies your team with a one-glance table.
2. 🧰 Prerequisites:
To use this template, you’ll need:
A self-hosted or cloud instance of n8n
A Surfe API Key (Bearer token for People Search & Bulk Enrich)
A Google Sheets account (OAuth2 or service account) with access to your criteria sheet
A HubSpot developer account (for the HubSpot Deal Trigger)
A HubSpot normal account  (where there is your deals, contacts, companies)
A Gmail account to send the enrichment summary email
The workflow JSON file (included with this tutorial)
Buying Group Criteria Excel (included with this tutorial)
3. 📌  Your input (Google Sheets)
This workflow uses a Google Sheet with two tabs:
Buying group reference values – A read-only reference list of all available options for the departments and seniorities columns. You’ll use this list to choose your search filters.
Your Buying Group Criterias – The sheet where you define the actual filters used in the workflow.
⚠️ Before you start: Import the provided Excel file into your Google Sheets account so both tabs appear exactly as in the template.
How to fill it the tab “Your Buying Group Criterias”:
departments (Column A) → Select one or more values from the reference tab. Only rows containing a value will be used in the search.
seniorities (Column B) → Select one or more values from the reference tab. Only rows containing a value will be used in the search.
countries (Column C) → Enter any ISO Alpha-2 country codes (e.g., fr, gb, de). This is a free-text filter.
jobTitles (Column D) → Enter any job title keywords you want to search for (e.g., CTO, Head of Marketing). This is also a free-text filter.
The workflow will read the filled cells from each column, clean duplicates, and pass them to the Surfe People Search API.

5. 🔄 How This N8N Workflow Works
A new deal is created in HubSpot, which triggers the workflow.
The workflow retrieves the company domain linked to that deal.
It reads the buying group criteria from your Google Sheet (departments, seniorities, countries, job titles).
These criteria are combined with the company domain to create a search payload for Surfe’s People Search API (limited to 200 people per run).
Matching contacts are then sent to Surfe’s Bulk Enrichment API to retrieve emails, phone numbers, and other details.
n8n polls Surfe until the enrichment job is complete.
Enriched contact data is extracted and filtered so that only contacts with at least one valid email or phone number remain.
These contacts are created or updated in HubSpot.
Finally, a Gmail summary email is sent to your team with a clean table of the new or updated contacts and direct links to view them in HubSpot.

6. 🧩 Use Cases
Net-new deal created → instantly surface the rest of the buying group and enrich contacts.
7. 🛠 Customization Ideas
🔁 Add retry logic for failed Surfe enrichment jobs
📤 Log enriched contacts into a Google Sheet or Airtable for auditing
📊 Extend the flow to generate a basic summary report of enriched vs rejected contacts
⏳ Trigger the enrichment not only on deal creation but also at a specific deal stage change
📧 Send the summary email to multiple recipients or a team mailing list
9. ✅ Summary 
This template automates buying-group discovery and enrichment off a new HubSpot deal, writes enriched contacts back to HubSpot, and emails a neat table to your team—so reps focus on outreach, not admin. 
Import it, connect credentials, point at your criteria sheet, and Let Surfe do the rest.
