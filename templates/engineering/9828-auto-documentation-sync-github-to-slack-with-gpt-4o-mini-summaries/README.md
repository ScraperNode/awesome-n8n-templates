> ⚡ **96 views** · ⚒️ [Engineering](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you need GitHub data beyond what the REST API gives you, [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/github) has a [repository scraper](https://scrapernode.com/github/scrapers/repositories) that extracts metadata at scale without token rate limits.

## Description

## Description:
Keep your internal documentation always up to date with this n8n automation template.
 The workflow listens for GitHub pull request merges to the main branch, detects any changes in documentation files (README, /docs, or OpenAPI specs), and automatically summarizes and syncs updates to Confluence (or internal knowledge systems). It also alerts your team instantly via Slack with a summary of what changed.
Ideal for DevOps, technical writers, and engineering teams who want to eliminate manual documentation updates after code merges.

## ✅ What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)
-  ⚡ Trigger on GitHub Pull Requests: Automatically activates when a PR is merged into the main branch.
- 🧩 Validate Merge Conditions: Ensures the PR is both merged and targeted at the main branch before continuing.
- 📥 Fetch Updated Files (README, Docs, OpenAPI): Retrieves key documentation files directly from the GitHub repository for analysis.
- 🔍 Detect Documentation Changes: Scans payloads for any doc-related keywords or file changes (README, /docs, or OpenAPI).
- 🤖 AI-Powered Summarization: Uses Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Mini to create a concise 2-3 sentence summary of the changes, perfect for documentation notes or changelogs.
- 📤 Post Summary to Slack: Shares the AI-generated summary in your #documentation-updates or #general-information channel for instant visibility.
- 📢 Team Notifications: Sends a detailed Slack message with PR title, author, repo, and branch for full transparency.
- 🔁 Continuous Sync: Every merged documentation update is detected, summarized, and communicated—without human effort.
