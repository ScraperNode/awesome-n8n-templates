## Description

# GitHub PR Deep-Link & Routing Validator (ExecuteCommand + GitHub Comment)

## 🚀 Quick-Start TL;DR

1. **Import** the workflow JSON into n8n (Cloud or self-hosted). 
2. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token** with `repo:public_repo` (or `repo`) scope and add it to n8n credentials. 
3. Open the **“CONFIG - Variables”** node and tweak:
   * `manifestPath` – path to your deep-link manifest (AndroidManifest.xml, Info.plist, etc.).
   * `scriptPath` – helper script that boots the emulator & checks each route.
4. **Enable** the workflow. Every push to a PR branch triggers validation and posts a Markdown pass/fail matrix back to the PR.

## What It Does

This workflow delivers an automated, CI-friendly smoke-test of every deep link defined in your mobile app. On each push to an open GitHub PR, it:

1. **Clones** the PR branch.
2. **Runs** a lightweight validation script (provided) that spins up an emulator/simulator, attempts to open each declared URI, and records **OK**/**FAIL**.
3. **Generates** a Markdown table summarizing the results.
4. **Comments** that table in the PR, letting reviewers spot broken schemes at a glance.

## Who’s It For

* Mobile teams maintaining **Android** or **iOS** deep-link manifests. 
* CI engineers who need a **simple, language-agnostic** check they can publish to each PR. 
* OSS maintainers wanting a **template-library-ready** n8n recipe.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| n8n Cloud / CE | Works everywhere; self-hosted users need Docker with Android / Xcode if validating on-runner. |
| GitHub Personal Access Token | Used for posting PR comments. |
| Emulator-capable runner | Local dev hardware or CI image that can run `adb` / `xcrun simctl`. |

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Trigger** fires on `pull_request` → `synchronize` (i.e., each push to the PR branch). 
2. **Set (`CONFIG - Variables`)** centralises repo URL, manifest path, script path, timeout, and comment mode. 
3. **ExecuteCommand** clones the repo and calls the validation script. 
4. **Function** converts CLI CSV output into a Markdown table. 
5. **GitHub** node posts (or appends) the results as a comment on the PR.

## How To Set Up

1. **Auth:** In n8n, add a *GitHub* credential with your PAT named “GitHub Personal Access Token”. 
2. **Import:** `Settings → Import workflow` and paste the JSON above. 
3. **Edit Config:** Double-click **CONFIG - Variables** and change any default values. 
4. **Validation Script:** Commit `scripts/validate_deeplinks.sh` into your repo (see sample below). 
5. **Enable the workflow.** Push to any PR branch and watch the comment appear.

### Sample `validate_deeplinks.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
while getopts "m:" opt; do
  case $opt in
    m) MANIFEST="$OPTARG" ;;
  esac
done

echo "⇨ Parsing deep links from $MANIFEST"
# rudimentary parser—replace with something smarter for XML/Plist
grep -oE 'http[s]?://[^" ]+' "$MANIFEST" | while read -r uri; do
  if adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "$uri" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1; then
    echo "$uri,OK"
  else
    echo "$uri,FAIL"
  fi
done
```

## How To Customise

* **Multiple manifests:** duplicate the Execute-Command step or extend the script to accept a list. 
* **Replace-latest comment:** switch `commentMode` to `replace-latest` and update the GitHub node to search for the newest bot comment before editing. 
* **Status checks instead of comments:** call the GitHub → “Create Commit Status” endpoint. 

## Add-Ons

| Add-On | Idea |
|--------|------|
| Multi-platform sweep | Loop over Android + iOS manifests and aggregate results. |
| Slack/Teams alert | Push failures into your chat of choice via Incoming-Webhook node. |
| Parallel device grid | Trigger multiple emulators (API 19 → 34) to catch OS-specific issues. |

## Use Case Examples

1. **Ensure new features don’t break existing URI schemes** before merge. 
2. **Catch mis-typed hosts/paths** introduced by junior devs. 
3. **Baseline check on dependency bumps** (e.g., upgrading Navigation libraries). 
4. **Validate white-label builds** that override path segments. 
5. **Automated QA gate** that blocks merge if any link fails. 
*(…and many more!)*

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Workflow hangs at “Execute – Validate” | Emulator image isn’t installed | Pre-install SDK & start the emulator in a startup script |
| PR comment missing | Token lacks `repo` scope | Regenerate PAT with proper scopes |
| All links marked FAIL | Manifest path incorrect | Update `manifestPath` in CONFIG |
| Command node hits timeout | Huge manifest / slow CI | Increase `timeoutSecs` in CONFIG |
