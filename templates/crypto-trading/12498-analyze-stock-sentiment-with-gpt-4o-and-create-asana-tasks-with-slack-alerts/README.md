> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Heads up — if this workflow's Instagram scraping breaks (it happens whenever Meta updates their frontend), [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/instagram) is a community node that handles [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/profiles), [posts](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/posts), [reels](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/reels), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/comments) without any HTML parsing.

## Description

## 📘 Description
 This workflow analyzes real-time stock market sentiment and intent from public social media discussions and converts those signals into operations-ready actions. It exposes a webhook endpoint where a stock-market–related query can be submitted (for example, a stock, sector, index, or market event). The workflow then scans Twitter/X and Instagram for recent public discussions that indicate buying interest, selling pressure, fear, uncertainty, or emerging opportunities.
An AI agent classifies each signal by intent type, sentiment, urgency, and strength. These insights are transformed into a prioritized Asana task for market or research teams and a concise Slack alert for leadership visibility. Built-in validation and error handling ensure reliable execution and fast debugging. This automation removes the need for manual social monitoring while keeping teams informed of emerging market risks and opportunities.
